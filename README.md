The Softalk Apple edition, Top 30 list as dataset with validating screenshots. An Excel spreadsheet is provided together with a set of exported CSV files. For data validation and basic curiosity, screenshots are provided. The first issue, September 1980, did not have a Top 30 list, so there are 47 lists of between 30 and 32 listed items per month. Ties on the computed index for position 30 would occassionally result in 31 or 32 items on the list.

The primary spreadsheet worksheet and its associated CSV export, , contain two columns per month with the first listing the index computed for that title for that month -- index values are NOT comparable across months, only used for ordinal positioning within a given month's list -- followed by a column which contains the ordinal position (1-30) for that month.

Index ties result in ties for a given ordinal position result in more than one item with the same position in a given month as well as ordinal numbers being missing for a list with tied items.

We are in the process of writing a script to generate 47 individual CSV files with the program, its index, and ordinal position for each monthly list.

## A Big Thank You to STAP Volunteer Peter Caylor

Peter Caylor has been a founding, mega-helpful volunteer to The Softalk Apple Project from its very beginning. He selflessly donated his personal scan of most of the issues of Softalk, then worked diligently with us to secure and scan the remaining issues. While these are non-archival quality scans -- being quick photocopies of some pretty beat issues, etc. -- Peter's contribution did allow the STAP project to get a quick start on our own and postdoc research collaborators activity.

When needing a subject to exercise his growing skills and interest in Decision Support Systems as part of his professional skills development studies, Peter had the great idea to OCR and transcribe the Softalk Apple Top 30 lists as a dataset. His "homework" assignment was an Excel spreadsheet-based forecasting model to see if he could predict the Top 30 list for the unpublished "49th issue" that would have appeared for September 1984.

For Peter's great work, he is the FIRST winner of a FactMiners' Data Digger achievement and will receiving his custom FactMiners/STAP Data Digger mug as soon as we design and have it made! :-)

## What's Ahead -- The FactMiners/STAP Data Digger Challenge!

As soon as we have the rules worked out and complete the "starting point" dataset files, FactMiners and The Softalk Apple Project will launch an on-going data-mining contest to stimulate interest in what can be done with a FacttMiners Fact Cloud beyond the typical simple human-reading of scanned copies of the magazine.

In the meantime, friends of FactMiners and The Softalk Apple Project are welcome to puruse these files and to begin to think about the kinds of questions and insights that could be gleaned from clever analyses of this dataset... and then imagine what we'll have to work with when we have a full metamodel-based, structural and content model of all the information (the elementary "facts") that will eventually be added to the FactMiners Fact Cloud of Softalk magazine.
