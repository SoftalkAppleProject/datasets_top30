This repository contains the Softalk magazine (Apple edition) Top 30 List as a dataset with validating screenshots and other helpful files and information to encourage and support Citizen Science/History data exploration. An Excel spreadsheet is provided together with a set of exported CSV files. For data validation and to satisfy folks' basic curiosity, screenshots of the Top 30 lists, as they appeared in the magazine, are provided. The first issue, September 1980, did not have a Top 30 list, so there are 47 lists of between 30 and 32 listed items per month. Ties on the computed index for position 30 would occasionally result in 31 or 32 items on the list.

The primary Excel spreadsheet -- and its associated CSV export of the primary data worksheet -- contain two columns per month for the 47 months of record. For each pair of columns per month, the first contains the index computed for that title for that month and the second column contains the ordinal position assigned for that index value for that month. NOTE: Index values are NOT comparable across months. This value is only used for ordinal positioning within a given month's list.

Index ties result in ties for a given ordinal position, and thereby result in more than one item with the same position in a given month, as well as ordinal numbers being missing on a list with tied items.

We are in the process of writing a script to generate 47 individual CSV files; one for each month of the award consisting of columns with the program name, its computed monthly index, and the ordinal position of that index within the list.

## A Big Thank You to STAP Volunteer Peter Caylor

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftalkAppleProject/datasets_top30/master/images/LoRes_Peter_Caylor_handsoff_Softalk_megascans_to_Jim_Salmons.jpg" width="420" align="left" hspace="10" border="1" />Peter "Lo-res" Caylor is a founding, mega-helpful volunteer on the grassroots **Softalk Apple Project** from its very beginning. He selflessly donated his personal scan of most of the issues of Softalk, then worked diligently with us to secure and scan the remaining issues. While this initial "Caylor Foundation scans" are non-archival quality for the most part -- being quick photocopies of some pretty beat issues, etc. -- Peter's contribution did allow the STAP project to get a quick start on our own and postdoc research collaborators' activities. 

In the photo here, Peter on the left hands off his initial scans to STAP project co-founder, Jim Salmons, at an informal ceremony at Bertha's in Baltimore following Jim's attendance and FactMiners/STAP project demo at the *Museums and the Web 2014* conference.

Needing a subject to exercise his growing skills and interest in Decision Support Systems, Peter had the great idea to OCR and transcribe the Softalk Apple Top 30 lists as a dataset as part of a professional development course he is taking. His clever "homework" assignment was to create an Excel spreadsheet-based forecasting model to predict the Top 30 list for the unpublished "49th issue" of Softalk that would have appeared for September 1984.

**For Peter's great work, he is the FIRST winner of a FactMiners' Data Digger achievement and will receiving his custom FactMiners/STAP Data Digger mug as soon as we design and have it made! :-)**

## What's Ahead -- The FactMiners/STAP Data Digger Challenge!

As soon as we have the rules worked out and complete the "starting point" dataset files, **FactMiners.org** and **The Softalk Apple Project** will launch an on-going STAP **Data Digger Challenge** to stimulate interest in doing the kind of exploratory analysis and insight discovery that will be possible with the full FactMiners' Fact Cloud of the complete run of Softalk magazine.

In the meantime, friends of FactMiners and The Softalk Apple Project are welcome to peruse these files and begin to think about the kinds of questions and insights that could be gleaned from clever analyses of this dataset. As Challenge entries accumulate, it will become increasingly easy to imagine the full potential of creating a metamodel-based, structural and content model of all the information (the elementary "facts") of the full run of Softalk magazine captured in a FactMiners Fact Cloud.

More soon... :-)
